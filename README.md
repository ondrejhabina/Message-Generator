# Message-Generator
This message generator serves as an oracle of the norse gods.

It is quite simple. The whole generator is an object with arrays of different strings which then get selected based on a randomly generated index number and subsequently put together to be logged in the console. 

I created this project using javascript. I ran this file in node.js.

Enjoy :)
